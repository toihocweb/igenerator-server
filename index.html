Okay, okay, it’s mine. I downloaded Tik Tok to see what my kids were raving about. That was years ago. It’s now March 2022, and I have been spending three to four hours a night on Tik Tok alone. It’s embarrassing for me to admit that, but it’s true. That time doesn’t include the time during the day when I sporadically check social media. That’s a lot of time every single day wasted scrolling.</p><p id="bb19" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jq jr ii js b jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ib gj">I’ve deleted Twitter, Facebook, and Tik Tok from my phone.

Habits are so powerful. I’m imagining what I could do with good habits. I feel a bit freer not spending all that time on my social media apps. I’ve noticed my mind feels quieter and calmer. It’s nice.</p><div class="ko kp fw fy kq kr"><a href="https://amzn.to/3yaHhK0" rel="noopener  ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><div class="ks o hi"><div class="kt o db dz ep ku"><h2 class="bn ij do bp kv kw kx ky kz la lb ih gj">Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones</h2><div class="lc l"><h3 class="bn b do bp kv kw kx ky kz la lb co">James Clear is a writer and speaker focused on habits, decision making, and continuous improvement.

I printed some more crossword puzzles to have on hand at night time. I also started listening to an audiobook last night (Billy Summers by Stephen King). I prepped the week’s smoothies and cold brew and made peanut butter bars. That kept me busy for about an hour. I still feel that serenity without social media. It reminds me of when I stopped reading the news for a few years because it was stressing me out. It seems like social media may be worse for my mental health than the news. I am looking forward to spending more time on things I enjoy, like spending time with my husband, cleaning, reading, exercising, writing, and watching horror movies.</p><div class="ko kp fw fy kq kr"><a href="https://amzn.to/3OPJXm1" rel="noopener  ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><div class="ks o hi"><div class="kt o db dz ep ku"><h2 class="bn ij do bp kv kw kx ky kz la lb ih gj">Billy Summers</h2><div class="lc l"><h3 class="bn b do bp kv kw kx ky kz la lb co">Amazon.com: Billy Summers (Audible Audio Edition): Stephen King, Paul Sparks, Simon &amp; Schuster Audio: Books</h3></div><div class="ld l"><p class="bn b gr bp kv kw kx ky kz la lb co">amzn.to</p></div></div><div class="le l"><div class="lk l lg lh li le lj jo kr"></div></div></div></a></div><p id="53e9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jq jr ii js b jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ib gj"><strong class="js ij">Day 3</strong>: My downtime is no longer spent mindlessly scrolling through social media. I can hear myself think again. I’m not bombarded with other people’s problems for hours on end every day. It brings a sense of boredom, peace, and calm. We often relate boredom to being something bad, but it’s not.</p><div class="ko kp fw fy kq kr"><a href="https://amzn.to/3kwgShF" rel="noopener  ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><div class="ks o hi"><div class="kt o db dz ep ku"><h2 class="bn ij do bp kv kw kx ky kz la lb ih gj">Out of My Skull: The Psychology of Boredom</h2><div class="lc l"><h3 class="bn b do bp kv kw kx ky kz la lb co">Amazon.com: Out of My Skull: The Psychology of Boredom (Audible Audio Edition): James Danckert, John D.

It’s been a great networking source for me. I am connecting with other professionals across the world that I would otherwise not ever meet. It has provided many opportunities in my career. Yesterday I made a new connection with someone who received a promotion at her company — the same company on my dream list. She hooked me up with freelance work there and it all happened in a matter of two days! Banning social media from my life is doing wonders for my work.</p><div class="ko kp fw fy kq kr"><a href="https://amzn.to/3MMC7rG" rel="noopener  ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><div class="ks o hi"><div class="kt o db dz ep ku"><h2 class="bn ij do bp kv kw kx ky kz la lb ih gj">LinkedIn Unlocked: Unlock the Mystery of LinkedIn to Drive More Sales Through Social Selling</h2><div class="lc l"><h3 class="bn b do bp kv kw kx ky kz la lb co">Amazon.com: LinkedIn Unlocked: Unlock the Mystery of LinkedIn to Drive More Sales Through Social Selling (Audible Audio…</h3></div><div class="ld l"><p class="bn b gr bp kv kw kx ky kz la lb co">amzn.to</p></div></div><div class="le l"><div class="lm l lg lh li le lj jo kr"></div></div></div></a></div><p id="e625" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jq jr ii js b jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ib gj"><strong class="js ij">Day 5</strong>: It’s finally feeling normal to NOT be scrolling through social media whenever I get bored throughout the day and for HOURS before sleeping. Unfortunately, I’ve been asked to scroll through Reddit and Instagram for an assignment. Do I refuse? Do I explain the challenge I’m doing? It’s research for an article I’m writing. I’m not sure what to do. Doing this research will technically break my no social media rule. Ultimately, I decided to do the research.

My days (and nights) are more enjoyable now. I have time to hear my own thoughts and go over things in my head. I’ve replaced my previously wasted time with audiobooks, crossword puzzles, journaling, and sleep. I’ve noticed I am getting sleepy earlier in the evening and am able to fall asleep earlier than I used to. I am never reinstalling those apps.</p><div class="ko kp fw fy kq kr"><a href="https://amzn.to/3y7kJtk" rel="noopener  ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><div class="ks o hi"><div class="kt o db dz ep ku"><h2 class="bn ij do bp kv kw kx ky kz la lb ih gj">Mind, body &amp; wealth journal | Daily guided success planner to achieve an abundant mindset, improve…</h2><div class="lc l"><h3 class="bn b do bp kv kw kx ky kz la lb co">Amazon.com : Mind, body &amp; wealth journal | Daily guided success planner to achieve an abundant mindset, improve health…</h3></div><div class="ld l"><p class="bn b gr bp kv kw kx ky kz la lb co">amzn.to</p></div></div><div class="le l"><div class="lo l lg lh li le lj jo kr"></div></div></div></a></div><p id="3a37" class="pw-post-body-paragraph jq jr ii js b jt ju jv jw jx jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km kn ib gj"><strong class="js ij">Day 25</strong>: I thought quitting social media would be more challenging.
