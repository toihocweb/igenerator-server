App publishers need a comprehensive suite of tools to help you build, release, and operate your apps, including services like authentication, data storage, cloud functions, and device testing. There are a variety of services that support Flutter, including <a class="au mv" href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/flutter/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Sentry</a>, <a class="au mv" href="https://appwrite.io/docs/getting-started-for-flutter" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">AppWrite</a>, and <a class="au mv" href="https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/flutter/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">AWS Amplify</a>.</p><p id="23d9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kp kq ja kr b ks kt kb ku kv kw ke kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li lj lk it gc">Google’s offering for app services is Firebase, and <a class="au mv" href="https://www.slashdata.co/developer-program-benchmarking/?" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">developer benchmarking studies by SlashData</a> show that 62% of Flutter developers use Firebase in their apps. So over the last few releases, we’ve been working with Firebase to expand and better integrate Flutter as a first-class integration. That has included bringing the Firebase plugins for Flutter to 1.0, adding better documentation and tooling, and new widgets like <a class="au mv" href="https://pub.dev/packages/flutterfire_ui" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">FlutterFire UI</a> that provide developers with reusable UI for auth and profile screens.</p><p id="c1c0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kp kq ja kr b ks kt kb ku kv kw ke kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li lj lk it gc">Today we’re announcing the graduation of Flutter/Firebase integration to a fully-supported core part of the Firebase offering.

With the updates to the <a class="au mv" href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Flutter Crashlytics plugin</a>, you can track fatal errors in real time, giving you the same set of features that are available to other iOS and Android developers. This includes important alerting and metrics like “crash-free users” that help you stay on top of your app’s stability. The Crashlytics analysis pipeline has been upgraded to improve clustering of Flutter crashes, making it faster to triage, prioritize, and fix issues. And lastly, we streamlined the plugin setup process so that it only requires a couple of steps to get up and running with Crashlytics, right from your Dart code.</p><h1 id="67a5" class="ly lz ja bn ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi kg mj kh mk kj ml kk mm km mn kn mo mp gc">Flutter Casual Games Toolkit</h1><p id="b03f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kp kq ja kr b ks mq kb ku kv mr ke kx ky ms la lb lc mt le lf lg mu li lj lk it gc">For most developers, Flutter is an app framework. But there’s also a growing community around casual game development, taking advantage of the hardware-accelerated graphics support provided by Flutter along with open source game engines like <a class="au mv" href="https://flame-engine.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Flame</a>. We want to make it easier for casual game developers to get started, so at I/O today we’re announcing the <a class="au mv" href="https://flutter.dev/games" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Casual Games Toolkit</a>, which provides a starter kit of templates and best practices along with credits for ads and cloud services.</p><figure class="ln lo lp lq gz lr gn go paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="ls lt dq lu cf lv"><div class="gn go oh"><img alt="" class="cf lw lx" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*wK4YI3N-Hh2vtDQ2" width="700" height="280" role="presentation"></div></div></figure><p id="2127" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kp kq ja kr b ks kt kb ku kv kw ke kx ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li lj lk it gc">Although Flutter isn’t designed for high-intensity 3D action gaming, even some of those games have turned to Flutter for non-game UI, including popular games like <a class="au mv" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tencent.ig" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">PUBG Mobile</a> that have hundreds of millions of users. And for I/O we thought we’d see how far we could push our technology, so we’ve created a fun pinball game that is powered by Firebase and Flutter’s web support. I/O Pinball provides a custom table designed around four of Google’s favorite mascots: Flutter’s Dash, Firebase’s Sparky, the Android robot, and the Chrome dinosaur, and lets you compete with others for the high score. We think it’s a fun way to showcase Flutter’s versatility.</p><figure class="ln lo lp lq gz lr gn go paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="ls lt dq lu cf lv"><div class="gn go lm"><img alt="" class="cf lw lx" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*87xQ1AYdEF2YrmQ1" width="700" height="394" role="presentation"></div></div></figure><h1 id="3962" class="ly lz ja bn ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi kg mj kh mk kj ml kk mm km mn kn mo mp gc">Sponsored by Google, powered by community</h1><p id="4f24" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kp kq ja kr b ks mq kb ku kv mr ke kx ky ms la lb lc mt le lf lg mu li lj lk it gc">One thing we love about Flutter is that it’s not just a Google product — it’s an “everybody” product.
